# A basic web process

I created this (probably in 2014) as a thought-experiment and internal tool for explaining the major steps of building a website to people who were unfamiliar with the process. My goal was to hint at the complexity of even the simplest site, and help illuminate all the considerations, decisions, and time that web professionals put into getting content online.

This is a content-centric process, because thatâ€™s my field, and because most of the sites I was working on at this point were informational or brochureware sites for a single organization (the University of California Office of the President). In many cases, we were using existing templates, so the design and development  processes were minimal.

Put another way, this was my answer to: *I need a website. Can you throw that up by Friday?*
